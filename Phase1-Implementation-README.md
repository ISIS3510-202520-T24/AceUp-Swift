  - Current and target grade tracking
  - Semester and year organization
  - Color coding for visual identification

### 3. Course Management UI
- **Files**: 
  - `Views/CoursesListView.swift`
  - `Views/CreateCourseView.swift`
- **Features**:

  - Search and filtering capabilities
  - Color picker for course themes
  - Grade weight distribution with validation
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes

### 4. Data Migration System
- **Files**:
  - `Services/DataMigrationService.swift`
  - `Views/DataMigrationView.swift`
- **Features**:
  - Sample data generation for testing
  - Progress tracking during migration
  - Data integrity verification
  - Clear data functionality for fresh starts
  - User-friendly migration interface

### 5. Updated Navigation
- Added "Courses" option to sidebar navigation
- Integrated courses view into main app navigation
- Added Data Migration option in Settings

### 6. Enhanced Assignment Repository
- Migrated from mock data to Firestore
- Updated `AssignmentViewModel` to use `FirestoreAssignmentRepository`
- Real-time updates across all views

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Assignments Collection (`assignments`)
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "userId": "string", 
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string?",
  "courseId": "string",
  "courseName": "string",
  "courseColor": "string",
  "dueDate": "timestamp",
  "weight": "number",
  "estimatedHours": "number?",
  "actualHours": "number?",
  "priority": "string",
  "status": "string",
  "tags": ["string"],
  "attachments": [AttachmentObject],
  "subtasks": [SubtaskObject],
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

### Courses Collection (`courses`)
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "userId": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "code": "string", 
  "credits": "number",
  "instructor": "string",
  "color": "string",
  "semester": "string",
  "year": "number",
  "gradeWeight": {
    "assignments": "number",
    "exams": "number", 
    "projects": "number",
    "participation": "number",
    "other": "number"
  },
  "currentGrade": "number?",
  "targetGrade": "number?",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

- Firebase Security Rules implemented for data isolation
- User authentication required for all operations
- Users can only access their own academic data
- Group data has appropriate member-based access control

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Setup Firebase (if not already done)
1. Ensure Firebase is configured in your project
2. Deploy the security rules from `FirebaseSecurityRules.md`
3. Ensure Firestore is enabled in your Firebase console

### 2. Data Migration
1. Open the app and navigate to Settings
2. Tap "Data Migration" 
3. Choose "Create Sample Data" to populate with example courses and assignments
4. Or create your own data using the course and assignment creation flows

### 3. Managing Courses
1. Navigate to "Courses" from the sidebar
2. Tap "+" to create a new course
3. Fill in course information including:
   - Course name and code
   - Instructor information
   - Credits and semester
   - Grade weight distribution (must total 100%)
   - Target grade (optional)

### 4. Managing Assignments
1. Navigate to "Assignments" from the sidebar
2. Assignments are now synchronized with Firestore in real-time
3. Create assignments and link them to courses
4. All changes sync automatically across devices

## 🔄 Real-time Features

- **Live Updates**: Changes to assignments and courses sync instantly
- **Offline Support**: Basic offline capabilities through Firestore SDK
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Data synchronizes across all user devices
- **Listener Management**: Automatic setup and cleanup of Firestore listeners

## 🧪 Testing

### Sample Data Includes:
- 4 sample courses (CS, Math, Physics, AI)
- 6 sample assignments with various priorities and due dates
- Realistic academic data for testing all features

### Verification:
- Data integrity checks during migration
- Course-assignment relationship validation
- Grade weight calculation verification

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Queries**: User-specific queries with proper indexing
- **Real-time Listeners**: Automatic listener management to prevent memory leaks
- **Local State**: Published properties for immediate UI updates
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient data loading and updates

## 🐛 Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling in all repository methods
- User-friendly error messages in migration interface
- Graceful fallbacks for network issues
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

## 📱 UI/UX Improvements

- Modern SwiftUI design patterns
- Consistent color theming
- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Empty state handling with helpful guidance

## 🔜 Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Calendar Events**: Implement shared calendar functionality
2. **User Availability**: Add availability tracking for smart scheduling
3. **Workload Analysis**: Persist workload analysis data
4. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Improve group features
