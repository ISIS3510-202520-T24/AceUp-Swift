- User Availability for smart scheduling  
- Workload Analysis persistence
- Enhanced collaborative features

### 📱 How to Test:

1. **Launch the app** and authenticate
2. **Navigate to Settings** → "Data Migration"
3. **Create sample data** to populate courses and assignments
4. **Explore Courses section** to create/edit courses
5. **Check Assignments** to see real-time Firestore integration

### 🎯 Success Metrics Achieved:
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for core academic data
- ✅ User data security and isolation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI
- ✅ Migration system for smooth rollout

## 🔜 Next Steps (Phase 2):

1. **Calendar Events Collection** - Shared calendar functionality
2. **User Availability Collection** - Smart scheduling features
3. **Workload Analysis Persistence** - Store analysis results
4. **Enhanced Group Features** - Better collaboration tools

**Phase 1 is production-ready!** 🎉
